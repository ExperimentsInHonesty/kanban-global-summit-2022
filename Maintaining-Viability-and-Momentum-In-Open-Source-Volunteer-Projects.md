<p>Management wants the improved results that Agile or Lean can bring, but how do you actually do it? Imagine that you couldn’t use money to motivate your team, that they could leave at any time and that you have to meet your stakeholder deadlines because they are counting on you.

<p>In this talk you will hear how our open source community used a combination of stripping down a project to the simplest tools possible (Github’s built in, and free, kanban boards) and easily customizable online team workshops to eliminate unfocused team routines, get deep project visibility, increase productivity, increase agency and accountability, reduce rework, publish software faster, improve recruitment, reduce training time, and to increase team adoption, buy-in and focus. All while delighting our product users, stakeholders and team members.
See how your teams can use the same techniques to achieve transformative results.
